# materials_mining

## Background
This is a collection of scripts (based mostly on Pymatgen, the Python API for the Materials Project) for carrying out simulations and analysis of materials for electrochemical and energy storage applications.  It breaks down into three major categories:

* electrochemistry: Large-scale analysis of electrochemical properties from materials databases.
* ionic_mobility: Analyzing large numbers of ionic mobility simulations and mining this data for correlations.
* miscellaneous: Does what it says on the tin.
