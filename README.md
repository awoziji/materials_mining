# materials_mining

## Background
This is a collection of scripts (based mostly on [Pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org), the Python API for the Materials Project) for carrying out simulations and analysis of materials for electrochemical and energy storage applications.  It breaks down into four major categories:

* electrochemistry: Large-scale analysis of electrochemical properties from materials databases.
* ionic_mobility: Analyzing large numbers of ionic mobility simulations and mining this data for correlations.
* miscellaneous: Does what it says on the tin.
* nanoparticle_tools: Mostly related to my [thesis](https://github.com/dchannah/thesis) work at Northwestern and no longer actively maintained, but here for archival purposes.
