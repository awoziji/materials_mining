# Miscellaneous
Some misc. scripts (and sample data) to facilitate my research.
* plot_results_bar.py: Reads in voltage window data from an external file (sample data in 1e_oxides_bar.dat) and plots conversion and intercalation voltage windows.

* ml_testing.py: A simple machine learning demo to correlate band gaps with chemical composition.  Uses the Materials Project database.
