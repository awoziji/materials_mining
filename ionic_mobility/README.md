# ionic_mobility

This collection of tools is designed to interact with a MongoDB containing the results of Nudged Elastic Band calculations.  Note that these Nudged Elastic Band calculations can use energies derived from anything (electrostatics, density functional theory, etc.) so long as image-wise energies are resolved and stores in the database.

* database_getter.py: Collection of methods to pull various quantities from the ionic mobility database.
